//Example One

var total = calculateArea(5, 6);//This is the function call for finding the area

function calculateArea(width, height){//This is the function for the rectangle
var area = width * height;//This is the calculated area for the rectangle
//console.log(" The Area of a Rectangle is " + area);//This will tell the console to print out the calculated area
    return area;//This will return the values from the function
}
//console.log(total);//This will enable the console to show the returned values


//Example Two

findingCircumference(5, 5, 3.14);//This is the function call for finding circumference

function findingCircumference(radius, radius2, pie){//This is the function for finding the circumference
    var circumference = radius * radius2 * pie;//These are the calculations required to find circumference: radius x itself x pie(3.14)
    //console.log(" The circumference of the circle is " + circumference);//This will tell the console to print out the circumference
    return circumference;//This will return the values from the function
}
//console.log(findingCircumference);//This will enable the console to show the returned values
