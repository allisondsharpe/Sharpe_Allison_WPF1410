//I am measuring the width and height for coding a website to adjust to a mobile user's screen resolution

var width = 640;//Calculating the width of the user's mobile device's screen resolution
var height = 960;//Calculating the height of the user's mobile device's screen resolution
var area = width * height;//Multiplying width and height in order to find the area
console.log(area);//This will tell the console to generate the area for the width and height
